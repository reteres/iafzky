	8、别像风一样来去无踪，不然我会找不到你。
	5、希望以后的日子，伸手就能够到你。
中秋节那天，单位照例放了一天假。正准备回家，乡下的朋友打电话来接我们全家去玩，到他的鱼池钓鱼。一边是母亲的再三叮嘱，一边是朋友的热情邀请，我犹豫着，最后一想：反正家里是自已的父母，改日再回无所谓的，就答应了朋友。玩了一天，晚上一回到家就接到母亲打来的电话，说她一天内打了几十个电话，从中午等到晚上，既不见我们回家，也不见回个电话，家里又没人，还以为我们在路上出了事，让他们担心死了。第二天上班，听同事们眉飞色舞地讲昨天一家人共度中秋的情景，看着他们那兴奋不止、意犹未尽的样子，心里越发不是滋味，我想像着母亲依在家门口一遍遍张望和最后失望、着急的情景，感到一种说不出的内疚。周末到了的时候，我赶紧带着一家三口往家赶。晚饭桌上，我正踌躇着该怎样给父亲解释，父亲却像平时没事一样问我路上好不好走、饿不饿。我拿出专门为他买的二锅头，满满地为他酌了一杯。父亲端起酒正准备喝，听到电视里响起陈红那首熟悉的歌：常回家看看，不觉停了下来。听了一会，慢悠悠对我说：“你听，我们的心情就跟那歌中唱的一样，我们不图你们为我们作多大贡献，只是盼你们常回家看看，……”
The style is the man.
Ma Ji hong's literary creation, is real expression of his personal spiritual quality, is the direct expression of his heart.
At the same time, I think his creation comes from a primitive impulse.
As far as I know, he was born in the countryside, and experienced the "cultural revolution" era, from snacks many bitter, not read many books.
With higher learning is the fate doomed to no man, since the day when I took to the society, it has the dedication to start with the text, and literature pursuit and thinking.
Or when I was serving in the army, he enthusiastically writing communication reports for the troops, to write prose and poetry, constantly appeared in the army and local newspapers.
A native of rural farmers, it is by his hard work and talent, began the long literary career.
Afternoon, finely sunshine through the white gauze curtain gap reflected on my face.
This is a kind of lonely summer afternoon, I so quietly sit by the window, as shown on computer "butterfly lovers" music will sadness fill my room.
So in a sad music thought some of the things of the past.
